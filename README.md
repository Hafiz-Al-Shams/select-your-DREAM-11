Anyone around the world can come visit this website, see information of these different players & select them for their dream team.


### **Technologies used to build this project:**

- REACT. Which is a JavaScript library for rendering user interfaces(UI), is used for building this project.
- TailwindCSS. Which is an open-source CSS framework, is used here.
- DaisyUI. Which is a component library that functions as a plugin for TailwindCSS, also used here.


### **3 key features of this project:**

- 1. In the Banner section while "Claim Free Credit" button is clicked every time 2000000coin will be added to the main balance in the right corner of the navbar.

- 2. In each player card while "Choose Player" button is clicked if the main balance is greater than or equal to that player's bidding-price that specific player will be added to the selected section. if selected player number reaches 6 or user tries to select same player again or main balance is less than bidding-price then clicking this "Choose Player" button will show different React-Toastify notifications on the UI based on different conditions stated above.

- 3. Just upper the players card section their are 2 joined buttons named "Available" & "Selected" which have Toggling Feature. By clicking "Selected" button selected players section will be showed on the UI & all available players section will be hidden, again by clicking "Available" button all available players section will be showed & selected players section will be hidden. This way toggling will happen. Also in the selected players section there is a "Add More Player" button at the bottom which while clicked will show the all available players section and selected players section will be hidden. Besides there is a 'delete button' in each player card in the selected players section which will delete that player from selected section while clicked.
